The Four-Function Calculator

Welcome to the Four-Function Calculator, a simple yet stylish calculator built with fundamental web technologies. This project is less about complex calculations and more about creating a functional piece of digital art. As the calculator itself says, "this calculator isn't designed to be useful, only to be looked at. this is art."
üé® Features

    Basic Arithmetic: Performs the four basic mathematical operations:

        Addition (+)

        Subtraction (-)

        Multiplication (x)

        Division (√∑)

    Calculation History: Keeps a running log of your previous results for easy reference.

    Clear Function: A CE button to reset the current calculation and start fresh.

    Unique Styling: Features a retro, pixelated design with a distinct color scheme and box shadows, using the "VT323" monospace font.

    No Decimals! In a bold artistic statement, this calculator exclusively handles integers.
